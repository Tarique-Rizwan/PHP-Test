### Case:

 You have a client who owns a Luxury Car Showroom. She has a form on the index page where people can contact her if they have any questions.

But the problem is that her competitors are using bots to enter false entries and bulk spam entries, due to which she misses out on the right ones and is causing a loss for her business.

She already has a frontend team and has reached out to you to provide a tested code of the backend  in the best possible way so she has the correct information.

We have added some instructions, and for the rest, we believe you, as a PHP developer, should know them.
